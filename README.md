# How-do-governments-respond-to-COVID-19

How do different governments react to the coronavirus outbreak? Do they intervene on time or too late relative to the peak of cases? The objective would be to identify which countries handle the virus better/faster, and if so how. This is informative to prepare for a second wave of the coronavirus or for furture health crises.
 
First, I visualise the evolution of the disease in 6 countries: China, the US, the UK, France, Spain and Italy. I adjust for population size and the timing of the outbreak. I use daily data of accumulated cases from: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset#covid_19_data.csv
 
Then, I use the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker to look at the response from governments: https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker
 
I use the stringency index as a proxy for government response. However, I am conscious that I am making a very poor use of this index (the last charts suffer from scaling bias). Much better can be done, feel free to pick this up :)
